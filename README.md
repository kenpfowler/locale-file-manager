| en.json     | file   | source locale file (can be any language) |
| .env        | file   | openai api key                           |

2. Configure your project in config.json

```json
{
  "locales": ["en", "fr-CA"],

  ConfigType,
  InMemoryConfigSchema,
  Locale,
} from "locale-file-manager/dist/lib";

const config: typeof InMemoryConfigSchema = {

# TODO:

Prepare for 1.0 release

- Goal: Manage locale files with minimal effort and efficient use of AI output.

- Unit test classes
- Keep README.md document updated
- OpenAI should not be dependency. User should be able to supply their own generations as long as it implements interface that works with program.
- Might consider removing deep-diff dependency since it is no longer maintained
- Add appropriate error handling and logging
